# triangle-tracker
#### This is an application that determines whether a set of three numbers can either make a scalene,Equilateral and or Isosceles triangle.
## Deployment
#### Enter the link into the url interface and click the prompt.
## Languages used
#### HTML and CSS on Atom.
## How the application Works.
#### If the sum of two sides is equal or exceeds the value of the third side, then the program will detect that the values do not form a definite triangle. --input - hypotenuse (7), opposite (2), adjacent (19) --output - values show an indefinite triangle. 2- if the values entered are all equal to one another, then the program would show that an Equilateral triangle. --input - first value (8), second value (8), third value (8) --output - Triangle is Equilateral. 3- if two values in the input are equal, third different, the program would show an iscoceles triangle. --input - first value (6), second value (6), third value(5) --output - Triangle is Iscoceles. 4- if the values entered differ but don't exceed each other by much, triangle would be a Scalene triangle. --input - first value (7), second value (5), third value (8) --output- Triangle is Scalene.
